# SQL_practice
keeping SQL skills fresh using dataset from Olympic games

So I want to answer the following questions in SQL:

1a) Create a table that lists all country IDs for countries that competed in both the summer and winter Olympics.

1b) Create a table that lists all country IDs for countries that competed in both the summer or winter Olympics.

2a) For each country give the average height and average weight of their athletes.

2b) For each country give the average height and average weight of their male athletes who won a gold medal.

3) Provide a list of athletes who won a gold medal and are shorter than the average Olympic athlete.

4) Provide the total number of medals won for each country in the summer Olympics whose GDP is greater than average GDP of countries with at least 1 Nobel Prize winner

5) Create a column named ‘participation_level’ that labels countries by the number of unique events they competed in between the summer and winter games.  For less than 10 the rating should be ‘low’ for 10-19 the rating should be ‘medium’ for 20+ the rating should be ‘high’.


Will comment out my thought process on answering the questions in my code. Thank you!
